## Deployment

To deploy the app, tell Peter to run `git push heroku master`

# term-project
PROJECT OUTLINE
Your project outline document is important for matching with a mentor TA, as well as developing an idea that can become a successful term project. You will write an outline document that lists each member of your team along with their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, you will include a list of up to 3 project ideas, and detail their requirments.

The requirments section for each idea should describe what problems that ideas is attempting to solve and how your project will solve them. It should describe the critical features you will need to develop, why those features are being included, and what you expect will be most challenging about each feature.

By this date, you should have a GitHub Classroom repo set up for your term project group (look out for a Piazza post about this after group formation!). Commit and push your project outline document to your repo by March 5. You will find out which of your ideas have been approved, and will be assigned a mentor TA shortly after. Then you should set up a meeting to go over the document together and solidify a single project idea.

Team Members
Peter Huson
	Worked for 10 months at an e-commerce company writing JQuery, MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript. Worked at an agricultural drone company writing Python and C++. Currently completing a robotics micromouse project in Python and C. Experienced with Hardware (not sure if that’s relevant). 
I’m not super familiar with Java, I wish I knew more about Abstracts and Interfaces. 

Kolya Illarionov
	Familiar with SQL, Python, Java. Worked for a business consultant using SQL for several months. Took CS19 last semester, and am far more comfortable with algorithmic/back-end parts and not good with guis. I have experience scraping data, and a strong statistical background. I want to get better at interacting with existing APIs.

Marlene Goetz
	Worked last summer on research in computational psychology, writing in R and analyzing large datasets. TA’ed for CS15 and CS16 - pretty solid understanding of Java and related data structures, some experience in Python. Interested in front end and design. I’m not very comfortable with backend and related. 

Bryce Blinn
	I have studied Java, Python,TensorFlow in Python, JavaScript, C, and x86 Assembly at Brown, and I have used Python independently as well. I believe my strengths are problem solving, I think I am good at finding solutions when problems arise in code, and my weaknesses are more front-end related, I am not very confident in graphical interfaces.

Project Ideas:

Solitaire with friends
	This is a program to play solitaire online, but allows for competition with another human or AI (like Tetris with Friends). The program will only generate solvable games and the winner will be chosen based on time of completion. The game can be enhanced by adding features like defensive and offensive powerups and in-game chats,. 
	Requirements:
	There are two modes: 
	AI vs human 
	Different levels of AI 
	Human vs human 
	Games are always solvable
	Machine Learning algorithm that generates solvable arrangements
	The project will have an extensive graphical interface
	Cards need to be projected and move
	User can interact with the cards and move them 
	Powerups can appear and be interacted with
	Can add features like powerups, chats, etc 
	This can be built upon and more features can be added easily 

Super-resolution Zoom-Enhance enabler
	This program enhances low quality photos using neural networks and an interface.
	Requirements:
	The program can take in a photo and produce another photo
	The new photo has to improve on the original in some way
	The program has a user interface
	The program can can use crop/zooming to work on photos

Reorganized Food Website/App
	This is a program kind of like “Yelp”, but food will be categorized by menu item. For example, you want to eat pad thai. Enter “Pad thai” into the search bar and the results that will be returned are firstly the different pad thai dishes nearby, along with the restaurant they are served at, prices, etc. 
	Requirements: 
	Connect with data available online 
	Parse menu images/files to compile data for different food dishes
	Create a graphical interface to display results 
	Allow for user interaction with the website 
	Allow for auto-update due to the program’s connection with google or another food 	information source
